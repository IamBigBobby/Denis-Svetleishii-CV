        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Denis.

          I'm 29 years old. I from Russia, was born in Novosibirsk. <br>
          <br>
          I would like to tell a little story about me. <br>
          <br>
          About one and half year ago, my wife foud out about rs scholl in twitter. And she offered me try myself in stage0. It was at the end of 2021. I faild. I was tried in stage1, but a couldn't resist. <br>
          <br>
          But I didn't give up and continued to study. <br>
          <br>
          When the war began, me, my wife and our cat left for Georgia. Now we live in Batumi. <br>
          <br>
          I tried again studied on Stage0 at last summer, and I finished it. I was really happy. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish stag1 one agane. <br>
          <br>
          But as you see, I have a goal and reach it. <br>
          <br>
          About my education. I studied at the Siberian State University as an engineer of bridges and tunnels construction. But I didn't complete it. Because I at the first student practice, I was disappointed in my choice. <br>
          <br>
          I used to work as an engineer in a construction laboratory. The work consisted in laboratory control of building materials. I have technical experience that always helps me. And now for almost 10 years I'm working as a swimming coach for preschoolers and children with special needs. This job gave me great inspiration (thanks to the children) to learn new things. I think that the combination of my past experience helps me to make a good products and be a good employee.
